## About Me

I'm not a creator, but I still want to create something, maybe some content or even thoughts.

I have been working for [Didi Global](https://web.didiglobal.com/) for two years as a frontend developer about online car-hailing business.

And now I'm working in a small unicorn company about frontend infrastructures construction.
