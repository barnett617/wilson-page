description: Why and How I build shell-path-manager
---

The background is that I have a lot of downloaded tools needed to be added to PATH. I found there is not a convenient way to do this.

So I tried to learn Shell by myself and make a small tool to achieve this.

During the process, I learned how to get to know terms of Shell by reading manual pages and got in touch with a lot of Shell commands that I didn't frequently used before, such as `chsh`, `chmod`, `touch`, `export` and `source` etc.

Before a long time, I have mentioned that I want to get to know how `export` and `source` works when I built my blog by Hugo. This time I have a deeper understand of that because only with that I can make my tool works as my expectation.
